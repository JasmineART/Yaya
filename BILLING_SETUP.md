⚠️ **Billing:** Not enabled yet (required for Cloud Functions)

## Step 1: Enable Billing (Required)

**Why?** Cloud Functions require a billing account (but you'll stay within the free tier)

**Free Tier Benefits:**
- 2 million Cloud Function invocations/month
- Gmail API: Unlimited
- Your expected usage: ~3,000/month = **$0 cost**

**How to Enable:**

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Click "Link a Billing Account"
3. If you don't have one, create a new billing account:
   - Add payment method (credit/debit card)
   - Set billing alerts for $5/month (safety net)
4. Link it to project: `yaya-starchild-email`

---

## Step 2: Once Billing is Enabled

Run this command to continue setup:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Yaya
./setup-google-email.sh
```

The script will:
- Enable required APIs
- Create service account
- Guide you through OAuth setup
- Deploy Cloud Function
- Update your website

## Alternative: Use EmailJS Instead (No Billing Required)

If you prefer not to enable billing, use EmailJS:

**Pros:**
- No billing account needed
- Quick 20-minute setup
- 200 emails/month free

**Cons:**
- API keys visible in frontend (less secure)
- Limited to 200 emails/month
- $7/month if you need more

**Setup EmailJS:**
1. See guide: `/workspaces/Yaya/SETUP_GUIDES/2_EMAIL_SETUP.md`
2. Sign up at: https://www.emailjs.com/
3. Follow the setup steps

## Recommendation

**For maximum security:** Enable billing + use Google Cloud Functions  
**For quick setup:** Use EmailJS

Both options will work perfectly for your poetry website!
