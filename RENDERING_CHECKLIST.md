## Quick Test

```bash
# Start server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
http://localhost:8000/index.html
http://localhost:8000/shop.html
http://localhost:8000/product.html?id=1

# Check console
ErrorMonitor.getSummary()  # Should show 0 errors

# Check rendering
document.querySelectorAll('.reveal:not(.active)').length  # Should be 0
```

## Expected Results

✅ **Home Page**
- See: Book cover, sticker images, "Featured Merch" heading
- No: Blank spaces, hidden content, HTML code

✅ **Shop Page**  
- See: 2 featured products + 5 in grid = 7 total products
- Each with: Image, icon + title, description, price, reviews
- No: `<i class="...">` text, missing images

✅ **Product Detail**
- See: Large product image, icon + title, full description, ISBN/SKU, reviews, price
- No: Raw HTML, missing sections

## Performance Check

```javascript
// Should all be < 100ms
performance.timing.domContentLoadedEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart
```

## Common Issues (If Any)

**Q: Icons still showing as code?**  
A: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache

**Q: Content still hidden?**  
A: Check console for JS errors, run `showAllContent()`

**Q: Products not loading?**  
A: Check `products.js` loaded, view source to confirm

## Success Criteria

When successful, you'll see:
1. ✅ Instant content visibility (no delays)
2. ✅ Icons render as icons (not `<i>` text)
3. ✅ All product information displays
4. ✅ Clean console (no errors)
5. ✅ Smooth animations (after content loads)
